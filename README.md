There are three separate parts: a "Grain Synth", a "Filterer", and a "Virtual Mallet".

Each of the parts uses Tab 3 of the "Simple" layout, as well as the accelerometer data from the phone.

Grain Synth controls:
Holding the smartphone with the screen up:
Tilting left/right controls the grain duration.
Tilting forward/back controls the grain trigger frequency.
Dragging the dot on the screen left/right crossfades the synth's tone from "ceramic" to "organic".
Drigging the dot up/down controls the volume.

Filterer controls:
Holding the smartphone with the screen up:
Tilting left/right controls filter cutoff of the Pads' lowpass filter.
Tilting forward/back controls the resonance of the Pads' lowpass filter.
Dragging the dot on the screen left/right moves the Grain Synth sound in the stereo field left/right.
Drigging the dot up/down moves the Grain Synth sound in the stereo field forward/back.

Virtual Mallet controls:
Holding the phone as though taking a phone call, move your arm down as if striking a bell.
